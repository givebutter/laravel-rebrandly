#Laravel Rebrandly
Laravel Rebrandly is a package around the rebrandly API using Laravel's facade system, and allows your app to quickly create, update, or delete custom shortlinks.

## Installation
To get started, install the `givebutter/laravel-rebrandly` package:

```
composer require givebutter/laravel-rebrandly
```

## Usage

Add the `REBRANDLY_API_KEY` variable in your `.env` file. 

By default, the package will generate short links based on rebrandly's default domain, `rebrand.ly`. To modify this default, add the `REBRANDLY_DOMAIN` variable in your `.env` file. 

Next, add the `Rebrandly` facade to the top of your file.

```php
use Rebrandly;

// ...

Rebrandly::links()->create(['destination' => 'https://google.com'])
```
> Note: The Rebrandly facade will return, in JSON format, the Rebrandly API response.
